# 🦉 Smart Wildlife Monitoring System

## 📖 Overview

The **Smart Wildlife Monitoring System** is an intelligent solution designed to observe, track, and analyze wildlife activity in natural habitats. By combining **IoT sensors, computer vision, and data analytics**, the system enables researchers, conservationists, and forest authorities to monitor biodiversity, prevent poaching, and study animal behavior with minimal human interference.

## ✨ Features

* 🎥 **Real-time Animal Detection** using motion sensors and/or camera traps.
* 🤖 **AI-powered Classification** of species with machine learning models.
* ☁️ **Cloud-based Data Storage & Analytics** for long-term monitoring.
* 📊 **Dashboard Visualization** with charts, alerts, and reporting.
* 🔔 **Instant Notifications** (email/SMS/IoT alerts) on detected activity.
* 🔋 **Energy Efficient** – optimized for low power consumption in remote areas.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Input Layer**: Cameras (CCTV, thermal, IR) & IoT sensors (motion, sound).
2. **Processing Layer**: Edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano) running ML models.
3. **Storage Layer**: Local + Cloud database for wildlife activity logs.
4. **Application Layer**: Web/Mobile dashboard for monitoring & analysis.
