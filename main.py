#speed of sound = 0.0343 cm per microsecond    

# Ultrasonic sensor timing logic:
# 1. First while loop (echo.value() == 0): Waits until the echo pin turns ON
#     program is stuck in this line as long as echo.value =0
#    This indicates the sound wave has started its return journey
# 2. We record the exact start time with time.ticks_us()
# 3. Second while loop (echo.value() == 1): Waits until the echo pin turns OFF
#    This indicates the sound wave has completely returned
# 4. We record the exact end time with time.ticks_us()
# 5. The time difference * speed of sound (0.0343 cm/Î¼s) / 2 gives distance in cm
#    We divide by 2 because the sound travels to the object and back 


# Note on distance variations:
# Even with stationary objects, we see slight variations in distance readings (403-404 cm)
# This is normal behavior for ultrasonic sensors due to:
#  - Microsecond timing variations between measurement cycles
#  - Small environmental factors affecting sound wave propagation
#  - Normal sensor measurement noise

#LDR - its resistance changes based on the amount of light falling on it.
#darkness - high resistance
#bright light - low resistance
#because light frees electrons in the semi conductor material
#analog pin measures voltage across LDR
#ADC converts this analog voltage into a digital number[0-4095] that the ESP can understand.
#ESP32 has a built in ADC. This converts analog voltage into a digital number(0-4095)


#The ESP32 uses a 12-bit ADC, providing a resolution of 4096 distinct values (0 to 4095).


# LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and ADC explanation:
# 1. LDR's resistance DECREASES when light intensity INCREASES
# 2. The LDR sensor module has a voltage divider circuit (LDR + fixed resistor)
# 3. This circuit converts resistance changes into voltage changes
# 4. The ESP32's ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) on pin 34 measures this voltage
# 5. The ADC converts the analog voltage to a digital value (0-4095)
# 6. Due to how most LDR modules are wired, readings are often inverted:
#    - Lower digital values = Brighter conditions
#    - Higher digital values = Darker conditions
# 7. To make readings more intuitive, we can invert: light_level = 4095 - analog.read()
# 8. The 4095 maximum comes from the 12-bit ADC resolution (2^12 = 4096 possible values)
# 9. For wildlife monitoring, this helps determine day/night patterns in animal behavior 


# The "Unknown" animal type (coded as 0) serves several important purposes:
# 1. Data integrity: ThingSpeak requires a value for every field in each upload. 
#    When no animal is detected (false positives or no motion), we still need 
#    a valid value to send.
# 2. Status tracking: "Unknown" provides a clear baseline in our visualization,
#    making it easier to distinguish between periods of no detection and actual
#    wildlife detection events.
